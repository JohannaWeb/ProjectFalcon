The Falcon Manifesto: Sovereign Connection
1. We Believe in Data Sovereignty
Communication is a human right, not a corporate asset. By building on the AT Protocol, ProjectFalcon ensures that users—not platforms—own their identities, their relationships, and their data. We aren't building a walled garden; we are building a gate to the open web.

2. UX is the Ultimate Feature
Decentralization has failed in the past because it was too difficult to use. ProjectFalcon exists to prove that "Sovereign" can also be "Seamless". We prioritize high-fidelity, real-time UX (Electron/Spring Boot) because beauty and speed are what make a platform feel like home.

3. Safety by Design, Not as an Afterthought
As a founder from a marginalized background, I know that "free speech" without safety is just a vacuum for harassment. Falcon is built with the lived experience that moderation tools must be as robust as the protocol itself. We are building the first decentralized "safe space".

4. The Bridge to the Future
We aren't just building a chat app; we are building the Communication Layer for the decentralized social era. We leverage the existing momentum of the ATmosphere to give users immediate value while paving the way for a world where "logging in" means bringing your own soul with you.

5. Iteration Over Perfection
We ship while we’re scared. We code through the "nothing" phase.We are building a million-dollar reality, one commit at a time.
