# Founder Story — Johanna
## Project Falcon

Falcon started by accident.

I got removed from discord communities for being a trans woman.

If a platform removes you, your history, relationships, and presence disappear with it.

That design assumption felt wrong.

So I opened an empty repository and began building an alternative — not another chat app, but a system where identity and trust exist independently from any single company.

## Background

I’m a self-taught engineer, coding since I was 15.

I work primarily in backend and systems architecture, with a focus on practical engineering over ideology. My approach is simple: use whatever tools allow the fastest path from idea to working system.

I live in Portugal and build independently. My learning style is intense and iterative — long focused cycles followed by refinement.

Outside of software, I lift weights and play jazz guitar. Both influence how I build: repetition, structure, and incremental improvement.

## Why Falcon

Existing platforms optimize for ownership:

- accounts instead of identities
- servers instead of protocols
- moderation through central authority

This works operationally but creates structural fragility. Communities and organizations depend entirely on platform decisions.

Falcon explores a different model:

- identity as a decentralized identifier (DID)
- trust derived from network relationships
- data anchored to protocols rather than vendors

The goal is not disruption for its own sake — it is reducing dependency on centralized control points.

## Early Build

Falcon was initially built solo over seven days as a proof of architecture.

Current system components include:

- microservice-based backend (Gateway, Core, Trust, SIV)
- decentralized trust graph experimentation
- AT Protocol integration
- Java + Spring Boot services
- Electron + React client
- containerized deployment and observability stack

The focus was validating technical direction, not polishing features.

## Approach

I believe good systems come from:

- building before explaining
- testing ideas through architecture
- keeping infrastructure simple enough to evolve
- prioritizing user experience over theoretical purity

Falcon is an ongoing experiment in what communication software looks like when identity is not owned by the platform itself.

---

## Status

Falcon is early-stage and evolving.

Conversations with accelerators and research communities are ongoing while the core architecture continues to mature.

The project remains builder-led and execution-focused.

---

## One Line

I didn’t start Falcon to compete with existing platforms.

I started it to see what collaboration looks like when users, not software companies, own identity.
