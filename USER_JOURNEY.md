# USER JOURNEY --- Project Falcon

## From Identity → Community → Collective Intelligence

Project Falcon is a collaboration environment built on portable
identity.\
Users bring their identity with them, join communities, collaborate in
real time, and the system turns activity into durable shared
intelligence the community owns.

This document explains the product from a user perspective --- not the
underlying architecture.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Entry: A user arrives with an identity

A user does not create a traditional platform account.

They sign in using: - a portable identity (AT Protocol / DID) -
cryptographic keys they control

This means: - identity persists across platforms - accounts are not
owned by Falcon - users can move providers without losing history or
reputation

**First outcome:**\
The user's identity exists independently of the application.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Joining a community

The user joins a community space.

Examples: - engineering team - open-source project - research
collective - private org

Access is based on: - identity - trust relationships - reputation or
credentials

Not: - email invites - platform-owned accounts

**Key shift:**\
Membership follows the person, not the server.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Collaboration begins

Inside the community, interaction feels familiar:

-   real-time messaging
-   channels
-   threads
-   async discussions
-   project coordination

This mirrors tools like Slack or Discord --- intentionally.

The difference: - identity is portable - social graph persists -
community data is not platform-locked

**User perception:**\
"It feels like Slack --- but I own my presence here."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. AI operates inside the community context

Falcon introduces Sovereign Integration Vessels (SIVs):

They: - summarize conversations - surface key decisions - extract
signals from noise - help teams stay aligned

But they run: - inside the community environment - tied to identity
context - auditable and controllable

Not: - external SaaS agents - opaque black boxes

**Result:**\
AI becomes a collaborator, not an external observer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Knowledge compounds over time

As the community operates:

-   conversations
-   decisions
-   technical insights
-   relationships

accumulate into a shared knowledge layer.

This layer is: - persistent - structured - identity-linked -
community-owned

Not: - lost in chat logs - locked behind a vendor - reset when platforms
change

**Long-term value:**\
The community builds institutional memory that cannot be taken away.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Portability and resilience

Because identity and trust are not platform-bound:

-   communities can move infrastructure
-   users retain reputation
-   collaboration continues across providers

Falcon is not the "owner" of the network.\
It is an environment that interoperates with it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Core Loop

1.  Bring identity\
2.  Join community\
3.  Collaborate\
4.  AI structures knowledge\
5.  Reputation + intelligence grow\
6.  Community becomes more valuable over time

This creates compounding value and long-term retention.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why this matters

Today's collaboration tools: - own user identity - lock communities into
platforms - lose context over time

Falcon enables: - identity-owned participation - community-owned
knowledge - AI-assisted coordination - portable digital presence

It shifts collaboration from: **platform-centered → identity-centered**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## One-sentence summary

A user brings their portable identity, joins a trust-based community,
collaborates in real time, and AI transforms that activity into lasting
collective intelligence the community owns.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Who this is for (initial users)

-   developer communities\
-   open-source teams\
-   protocol ecosystems\
-   research and technical groups\
-   distributed organizations

These groups benefit most from: - persistent identity - long-lived
knowledge - non-platform coordination

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What happens next

After the first session: - identity persists - community ties
strengthen - AI context improves - knowledge compounds

Retention is driven by: - reputation - shared history - accumulated
intelligence

Not by platform lock-in.
