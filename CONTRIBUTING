# Contributing to Falcon

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Falcon. We are building the foundational collaboration layer for developer ecosystems, and we value high-quality contributions from the community.

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our professional standards and technical requirements.

## Development Philosophy

Falcon is built on three core principles:
1. Performance First: Technical communities require low-latency communication and efficient resource usage.
2. Type Safety: We prioritize robust, predictable code to ensure platform stability.
3. Extensibility: The architecture must remain modular to support future developer workflows.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs
* Check the existing Issues to ensure the bug has not already been reported.
* Open a new Issue using the Bug Report template.
* Provide a clear description of the behavior, steps to reproduce, and your environment details (OS, Browser/Client version).

### Suggesting Enhancements
* Open an Issue labeled "Feature Request."
* Clearly describe the problem the feature solves and the intended workflow.
* Maintainers will review the request to ensure it aligns with the long-term product roadmap.

### Pull Requests
1. Fork the repository and create your branch from main.
2. Ensure your code adheres to the existing architectural patterns.
3. Include unit tests for any new logic or bug fixes.
4. Update documentation if your changes modify public APIs or core workflows.
5. Submit the PR with a concise description of the changes.

## Technical Standards

### Code Style
* Follow the language-specific linting rules defined in the repository.
* Use descriptive variable and function names.
* Maintain a high level of modularity; avoid monolithic functions or files.

### Commit Messages
We follow a structured commit format to maintain a clean project history:
* feat: A new feature for the user.
* fix: A bug fix for the user.
* docs: Changes to the documentation.
* refactor: Refactoring a specific section of the codebase.
* perf: Performance improvements.
* chore: Routine tasks or maintenance.

Example: feat: implement role-based access control for community spaces

### Architecture and Design
Falcon is currently focused on:
* Core Infrastructure: High-concurrency messaging and data persistence.
* Identity Layer: Contributor profiles and role management.
* Client Performance: Desktop-class responsiveness and resource management.
