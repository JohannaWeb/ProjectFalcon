# Security Policy

## Overview
Project Falcon is built on the principle that "Communication is a human right." Security is not a feature but the foundation of our Sovereign Seamless mantra.

## Our Security Philosophy
1. **Identity Sovereignty**: We leverage DID/PLC for identity. We never hold your private keys.
2. **Transport Security**: All real-time communication via WebSockets is encrypted using industry-standard TLS 1.3.
3. **Identity Verification**: Authentication frames are signed at the protocol layer to prevent spoofing within the decentralized mesh.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
We value the contribution of the security community. Please report vulnerabilities via:
1. Opening a confidential GitHub Security Advisory.
2. Emailing security@projectfalcon.io (PGP key available upon request).

We aim to acknowledge all reports within 24 hours and provide a resolution timeline within 72 hours.
