## 1. The Vision: Break the Walled Gardens
Modern collaboration lives in **"digital prisons"** (Slack, Discord). Our identities and our communities are locked in corporate silos, existing only by the grace of a host. If they deplatform us, our history is erased and our people are scattered.

**Project Falcon** is the breakout tool. Built on the **AT Protocol (Bluesky)**, it provides a high-fidelity, real-time communication layer where the **User remains Sovereign**. We are building a home that no one can take away.

## 2. The Thesis: Sovereign & Seamless
We are betting on the idea that community resilience is the most important technology of the next decade.
* **Sovereignty:** Your social graph belongs to you, not a CEO.
* **Resilience:** We reject the idea that "Decentralized" means "Clunky". 
* **Moat:** **UX as the Ultimate Feature**.

## 3. The "Moat" (Safety & Sovereignty)
* **Portable Identity:** Users own their handles and relationships via DID:PLC.
* **Safety by Design:** Protocol-level moderation tools that empower communities to define their own boundaries without central gatekeepers.
* **Protocol-First:** A gate to the open web, not a wall around a garden.

## 4. Market Strategy: Developer-First
* **Phase 1 — Elite Tech Networks:** Paid access to high-signal developer hubs.
* **Phase 2 — The Shippers' Layer:** SaaS integration suite (SIV for the open web).
* **Phase 3 — Platform Expansion:** Scaling to creators and global enterprise.

## 5. Technical Maturity
* **Engine:** Java Spring Boot 4.x + **Project Loom** (Virtual Threads) for high-concurrency performance.
* **Founders:** **Joana Almeida** (Senior Architect, 9yr experience)
* **Fidelity:** React + Electron for a low-latency, premium experience.
* **Security:** Verified identity mapping and anti-spoofing via AT Protocol.
