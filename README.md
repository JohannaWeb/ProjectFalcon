# Project Falcon

**Collaboration without platform lock-in.**

Slack owns your workspace.  
Discord owns your community.  
AI platforms own your context.

When you leave, everything stays behind.

Project Falcon makes collaboration portable — your identity, history, and intelligence move with you instead of belonging to a platform.

## The Problem

Modern collaboration software works by trapping users.

Teams invest years of conversations, workflows, and knowledge into tools they cannot leave without losing context. Switching platforms means rebuilding identity, history, and trust from scratch.

AI tools make this worse: intelligence becomes centralized behind APIs that users cannot control or verify.

The internet evolved into platforms that own participation instead of enabling it.

---

## The Idea

Collaboration should work like email or the web:

- identity belongs to the user
- data exists beyond any single app
- tools compete on experience, not ownership

Project Falcon explores a different model:

Log in once.  
Keep your identity everywhere.  
Bring your context with you.  
Run intelligence as infrastructure, not a service.

Platforms become interfaces — not gatekeepers.

---

## What Falcon Is (Today)

Falcon starts as a real-time workspace for developers.

It connects identity, activity, and AI assistance into a single live environment where context follows the user instead of the application.

You don’t join Falcon as a platform.

You connect through it.

The current client is intentionally minimal — a proof that portable collaboration can work in practice.

---

## Why Now

Two shifts make this possible for the first time:

1. **Portable identity** — users can exist independently of platforms.
2. **Local and distributed AI** — intelligence no longer requires centralized control.

Together, they allow collaboration software to be built without ownership as a requirement.

The next generation of tools will win by reducing lock-in, not increasing it.

---

## Approach

Falcon is built around a simple principle:

> Infrastructure should outlive the interface.

Instead of designing a destination platform, Falcon focuses on the layer that allows many platforms to exist.

Start small.
Ship continuously.
Let real usage shape the system.

## Current Status

Active development.

- Shipping daily
- Fast iteration cycles
- Real users testing early workflows
- Continuous refinement of the core collaboration loop

The goal is not completeness — only progress toward a portable collaboration model that works in reality.

---

## Vision

The internet moved from:

websites → platforms

The next shift is:

platforms → protocols.

In that world:

- identity travels with people
- communities survive software changes
- intelligence runs anywhere
- switching tools becomes trivial

Project Falcon is an early step toward that transition.

---

## Philosophy

Falcon is built on a simple belief:

Software should empower participation without demanding ownership.

The best infrastructure disappears into the background — enabling people to work together without deciding where they are allowed to exist.
