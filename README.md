# Project Falcon

**Portable collaboration for developers.**

Falcon is a workspace where your identity, history, and AI context follow you across tools instead of being locked inside platforms.

*Built in Porto. Shipping daily.*

---

## The Idea

Login once. Keep your context everywhere.

- persistent identity
- shared collaboration context
- AI assistance that follows your work

Platforms become interfaces — not owners.

---

## Example

```
falcon login
falcon connect github
falcon connect discord
falcon open
```

Open a workspace and your context is already there.

No migration. No reset.

---

## Why

Developers work across many tools, but context stays trapped inside each one.

Switching platforms means rebuilding workflows, history, and AI understanding from scratch.

Falcon separates collaboration from the platform.

---

## Status

Early development.  
Demo starting now.  
Shipping daily.

---

## Vision

Email separated communication from providers.  
The web separated content from hosts.

Falcon explores collaboration that outlives platforms.
