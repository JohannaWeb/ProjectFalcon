## Founder Overview

Technical founder and systems architect with 10+ years building distributed JVM infrastructure for global production environments (BMW Group, enterprise data platforms). Currently building **Project Falcon** — a sovereign, protocol-native real-time communication layer built on the AT Protocol.

Focus areas:
- High-concurrency JVM systems (Project Loom)
- Decentralized identity (DID:PLC)
- Protocol-first architecture replacing SaaS lock-in
- Real-time ingestion infrastructure

Positioned at the intersection of:
- Identity
- Distributed systems
- Post-SaaS collaboration infrastructure

# Project Falcon

### Technical Founder  
Feb 2026 – Present | Porto

**Project Falcon is a sovereign real-time communication infrastructure layer built on ATProto — designed to replace centralized collaboration platforms with portable identity, protocol-native messaging, and zero platform lock-in.**

### Architecture & Execution

- Built a Loom-based distributed backend capable of ingesting global AT Protocol firehose traffic with sub-60ms event latency.
- Designed a microservices monorepo optimized for rapid iteration and deterministic deployments.
- Implemented a Zero-Trust Gateway performing cryptographic DID/JWT verification, removing reliance on centralized user stores.
- Architected identity portability via DID:PLC, enabling user migration across services without platform dependency.
- Created Sovereign Integration Vessels (SIVs) to ingest and normalize real-time signals from developer ecosystems (GitHub, Vercel, ATProto).
- Established high-frequency backend iteration cycles with ~32-second build/deploy feedback loops.

### Founder Role

- Leading protocol architecture, backend systems, and identity layer design.
- Driving technical narrative and infrastructure positioning within the ATProto ecosystem.
- Engaging with distributed systems and protocol engineering communities.
